DESCRIPTION : 

Hotels.com owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Hotels.com is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Hotels.com wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# Key Metrics




In the online travel industry, several key metrics help to assess the revenue performance of Hotels.com. Understanding these metrics is crucial to track the company's financial health and profitability.

RevPar: Revenue per available room.

RevPar is a metric used to evaluate Hotels.com's revenue-generating ability. It is calculated by dividing the total room revenue by the number of available rooms.

For example, if Hotels.com has 100 rooms available and earns $10,000 in room revenue, then the RevPar would be $100.

Occupancy%: Occupancy percentage.

Occupancy percentage is the percentage of rooms that are occupied during a given period. It is calculated by dividing the number of rooms sold by the number of available rooms.

For example, if Hotels.com has 100 rooms available and 50 rooms were booked and occupied, then the occupancy percentage would be 50%.

Revenue: Total revenue generated by Hotels.com.

Total revenue generated by Hotels.com is the sum of all revenue earned from room bookings, food and beverage sales, and other sources. It is a crucial metric that reflects the financial health of the company.

DSRN: Daily Sales Revenue per occupied room night.

DSRN is a metric used to evaluate Hotels.com's revenue-generating ability per occupied room. It is calculated by dividing the total sales revenue by the number of occupied room nights.

For example, if Hotels.com earns $1,000 in sales revenue and has 100 occupied room nights, then the DSRN would be $10.

ADR: Average daily rate.

ADR is the average daily rate charged for a hotel room. It is calculated by dividing the total room revenue by the number of occupied rooms.

For example, if Hotels.com earns $10,000 in room revenue and has 50 occupied rooms, then the ADR would be $200.

No Shows: No Shows occur when a guest does not arrive at the hotel on the scheduled check-in date and time.

Utilized Room Nights (URN): URN refers to the number of rooms that are occupied by guests.

NOTE: For the hospitality industry (hotel industry), the weekend is Friday and Saturday, and the working days are Sunday to Thursday.

Level-wise Analysis:

In the online travel industry, level-wise analysis is crucial to find out the root cause of a problem. It involves four levels of analysis:

Level 1 Analysis: Utilized Room Nights (URN) and Booked Room Nights (BRN).

URN is the number of rooms that have been used by customers, while BRN is the number of rooms that have been booked by customers.

By calculating the realization (URN/BRN), Hotels.com managers can determine the actual revenue earned against the total bookings made.

Level 2 Analysis: Channel level view.

By analyzing different booking channels such as online travel agencies, direct bookings, or third-party booking websites, Hotels.com managers can identify any issues in the booking process.

Level 3 Analysis: Regional view.

By analyzing the performance of different hotels in different regions, Hotels.com managers can identify the factors contributing to the problem.

Level 4 Analysis: Root cause.

This involves identifying the root cause of the problem and taking corrective measures to address it.

# Key Insights and Suggestions for the Business:


We have analyzed the data provided by the business stakeholders which only covers May, June, and July of 2022. Therefore, our analysis is limited to this three-month period.



Insight: Hotels.com Exotica in Mumbai has earned the highest revenue among all the other hotels across all the cities, with revenue of 210 million INR. If we see the average ratings of this hotel, then it has a very good rating of 4.32, implying that it is not only generating good revenue but also providing good service and customer satisfaction.

Suggestion: Since Hotels.com Exotica in Mumbai is performing well in terms of revenue generation and customer satisfaction, the business can replicate this hotel's business model in other cities to improve their performance.



Insight: Grands in Delhi has generated the lowest revenue but still has managed to get an average rating of 4.25, which is good.

Suggestion: From the ratings, we can understand that the service provided by Grands is good. However, it has failed to generate good revenue. We should discuss this with the manager of this hotel and find out the constraints as this hotel seems to have the potential of earning more revenue.



Insights and Suggestions: Hotels.com Palace in Mumbai has the highest RevPar (Revenue per Available Room) rate, which is at 10,592.27 INR, and it has also maintained a good average rating of 4.29. Hence, we can apply the same business model this hotel is utilizing in other hotels if the business wants to increase the RevPar rate for all hotels maintaining a good average rating.

However, it is important to keep in mind that each hotel operates in a unique environment and may require different strategies to increase its RevPar rate. Therefore, it would be necessary to conduct further analysis to determine the specific factors that are contributing to the success of Hotels.com Palace in Mumbai and adapt those factors to other hotels accordingly.



Insight: On the other hand, Hotels.com Exotica in Hyderabad is performing very poorly. It has the lowest RevPar rate at 4,061.33 INR and has only generated 47 million INR in revenue. From the average ratings (2.33), we can say that this hotel is not at all providing good customer service.

Suggestion: We must reach out to the regional manager immediately and conduct a serious discussion to find out the weak spots and challenges this hotel is facing to improve the business.



Insights and Suggestions: In today's world, ratings and feedback play a crucial role in determining business performance and future growth. People tend to visit hotels where the average rating is good. Hence, it is essential to maintain a good average rating for all businesses.

It is crucial for businesses to regularly monitor and respond to customer feedback and ratings to maintain a good reputation and attract new customers. By addressing customer concerns and improving services, businesses can increase customer satisfaction and revenue.

Now, from our analysis, we can say that Hotels.com Seasons in Mumbai has the lowest average rating of 2.30. We can see that the ADR for this hotel is pretty decent, which stands at around 16.5k. However, if this hotel does not improve its services, then in the future, this hotel's all KPIs will start declining.

The decent ADR for this hotel may indicate that the hotel is attracting customers based on other factors such as location or pricing or due to fewer competitors in that region. However, it is important to keep in mind that a low average rating may eventually impact the hotel's revenue and overall performance if the issues are not addressed. Therefore, it is important for the hotel to focus on improving its services and maintaining a good reputation to ensure long.







# Dashboard/Analytical Tools:



A good dashboard or analytical tool should enable hotel managers to ask "why" questions and find the root cause of the problem. 

It should provide an easy-to-understand visualization of the data, highlighting key metrics such as RevPar, occupancy percentage, revenue, DSRN, and ADR.

It should also allow managers to drill down into the data and identify specific issues that need to be addressed.
